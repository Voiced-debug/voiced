                        <h3>About the Foundation</h3>
                        We are a non-profit organization which is well informed about the current spike in trauma and depression in young and old alike.
                        We are focused on educating the public both male and female alike about this current health issue which is affecting the population.
                        If anyone has been a victim, we are dedicated to the cause of that person whether therapeutic sessions, stress relieving exercises and legal aids
                        for our family. We believe when the mind is at peace, there would be room for growth and development not only for 
                        the individual but society at large.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
                        To set those who have been through any form of victimization free. Helping those who have hitherto been muted find their own voice and place
                        with theirselves and the world. By educating the public we hope the level of victimization would drop and our society would be safe for old and young.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h3>Vision</h3>
                        See our society rid of the vices related to sex and better breed individuals who positively stand out among
                        their counterparts. Help victims find a closure and embrace themselves without thinking of putting an end to their lives.
